				<span id="green">pani puri</span>
				<p>"Panipuri consists of a round or ball-shaped, hollow puri (a deep-fried crisp crepe), filled with a mixture of flavored water (known as imli pani), tamarind chutney, chili powder, chaat masala, potato mash, onion or chickpeas.
                Fuchka (or fuska or puska) differs from Panipuri in content and taste. It uses a mixture of boiled yellow peas and spiced mashed potatoes as the filling with sliced onion mixture as the toppings. It is tangy rather than sweetish while the water is sour and spicy."</p>

        		<span id="orange">meat</span>
        		<p>"Meat is animal flesh that is eaten as food.[1] Humans have hunted and killed animals for meat since prehistoric times. The advent of civilization allowed the domestication of animals such as chickens, sheep, rabbits, pigs and cattle. This eventually led to their use in meat production on an industrial scale with the aid of slaughterhouses."</p>
